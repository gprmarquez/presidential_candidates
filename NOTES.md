Theres are notes for the first attempt at the CLI Gem Project.

My project will involve looking at a site of presidential candidates, scraping their information and assigning them as individual objects. These objects could be called upon and methods could call specific attributes from the objects. 

For example, if one would like to learn more about Bernie Sanders, they could drill into whatever information that website contains for each profiled candidtate, like their platforms, social media, weblinks, emails, and speeches (if available).

The program will be interactive and allow the user to navigate through the information.

The program will only scrape once, and assign the different attributes to each object, per candidate.

The link to be used is the following:
